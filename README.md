## Assignment – recreate and improve

* ✅ Recreate the code/steps of the presentation (Node and npm).
* ✅ Add a date library of your choice from npm.
* ✅ Add a function that writes current date and time to your file when you run your script.
* ✅ Add a function that writes how long it was since you started this course.
* ✅ Allow for sending in a date as an argument
    - ✅ Write the argument-date to your file
    - ✅ Add a function that figures out if date sent in as a argument is before or after the date when you run the file.
* ✅ Make sure all the dates and times has a nice formatting that "everyone" can understand.
* ✅ Add a function that also creates a plain, runnable html-file (index.html) in addition to the index.md file. Include relevant markup and styling.
* ✅ Create a public GitHub repo (if you haven't already, or a private repo but by also inviting me as a contributor) and "upload" your code.
* ✅ BONUS: Add a unit test for some part of the assignment (in addition to the example I showed during class)
